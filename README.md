# Blockchain
This project illustrates the fundamental concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency including:
- Blocks that store data
- Digital signature "chaining" the blocks together
- Proof of work (mining) to validate new blocks
- Ability to check if the data in the blockchain hasn't been tampered with and is still valid
- Ability to create and use wallets
- Public and private keys generated using the Elliptic-Curve cryptography approach
- Making transactions
- Secure transfer of funds ensured by the digital signature algorithm

## Dependecies
- gson `gson:2.8.2.jar` (to print the blockchain in JSON format)
- bouncy castle `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.56` (set bouncy castle as Security Provider)

## Java version
- jdk1.8.0_241
